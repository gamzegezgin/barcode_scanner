While working on this app, which scans ISBN barcodes to find and add books to a list, I used the following packages:

provider

mobile_scanner

syncfusion_flutter_xlsio

path_provider

permission_handler

flutter_local_notifications

open_file

I am still working on exporting the book list to Excel.
